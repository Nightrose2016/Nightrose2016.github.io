Never have I Ever met something that would made me want to drink as much as this project.  first project got a 4 torpedo alvo launched at it from the start!.  scrapped it and did a idea that came to me while I was nursing my own Long island iced tea creation.  A BEVERGE RECIPE FLASHCARDS!  so I started making it the next day!  Still tracking some bugs down on the project but by next thursday I should be good!
