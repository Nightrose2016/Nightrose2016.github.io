After 1 month and more stress than I personally could handle being "forced" to take a 2 week break because of becoming a nervious wreck every time I look at my code it is done! I ended up having to start over yesterday because Oauth refused to work!  so with help I used devise and copied the project over.  That said new repository is at https://github.com/Nightrose2016/WoD-Character-manager because devise has to be set up AT the begining!

Now on to the actual project.  I came up with the project because my Fiancee is a DM/GM and constantly complains about having to manually keep track of character sheets.   It was definitly interesting and its going to be used for my reactos project as I had many plans for it but what we had been taught wasn't sufficient to get it where I wanted. At some point there are going to be limitations placed on skill points with only GMs going to be able to add skill points past 5 as in the universe 5 is considered peak human ability and everything past that is "not human".






Keeping the lines below this for prosterity and I like how rambly I got just to meet a character limit

Yeah. just gonna do this about my rails project later. after I actually figure out what they want in these dang blog posts.  Like I need guidlines not a vague make it about your code talk about your project kind of deal.  Oh this is new 250 character limit.  so at this point anybody still reading stop because I made this blog a train wreck because of that character limit.  Please stop reading.  Or keep reading I'm not your mother.
