Yeah. just gonna do this about my rails project later. after I actually figure out what they want in these dang blog posts.  Like I need guidlines not a vague make it about your code talk about your project kind of deal.  Oh this is new 250 character limit.  so at this point anybody still reading stop because I made this blog a train wreck because of that character limit.  Please stop reading.  Or keep reading I'm not your mother.
