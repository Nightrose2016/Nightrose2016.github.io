Blah blah blah... jush kiding.  So I have had quite a bit of experience with really beginer level coding.  I had worked on some mods for various games that required a little bit of coding knowledge.  After my college screwed me over for the last time regarding graduation I said screw it for my cyber security degree and just didn't know wha to do with my life.  After working on yet another mod for some random game I said "what about coding?" so I apllied to Flatiron on here I am.  1 month later and having just "completed" my first project.

Ah yes that project.. its not complete. Not by a long shot.  I still have more I plan to do with it .  It is a portfolio piece after all.  I know some of the code is still wonky.  I need to fix quite a few things.  but with how it is now... I can live with it.  It pulls movies reliably but not so much with anime TV shows.  So thats going to be something I have to fix.  I think I pinned why it does it but I need to find a good solution.  Till then though its showiung the URL so people can actually still look up the anime if it wonks out on them.  but hoepfully by the end of this week when I have the time I'll work on it some more.  either way I should get back to it.

Peace out
