I really hate these blogs you know?

This project started as a javascript to keep things fresh while I as on a leave of absense. I then transformed it into a react project figuring that react would be better served. There hasn't been a guide app around a certain game I like which is why I made this one.  It still needs some work but as it stands I could release it here and now.  Currently logins work but nothing "works" with the login.  Its there as just a feature that I want to make use of at some point.  I plan on using it to track a users progress in the game and then show things on the homepage according to where they are at that point in time.  I'm being vague here since the game has a huge following and the less attention i draw to this unfinished project the better.
